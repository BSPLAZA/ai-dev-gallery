# Log Evaluation Button Debug Checklist

## Current Symptoms
- Button appears blue (enabled) ✅
- Button text shows "Log Evaluation" ✅ 
- Clicking button has no effect ❌
- No errors shown in UI ❌
- Debug logs show IsReadyToExecute = true ✅

## Investigation Checklist

### 1. Event Handler Binding
- [ ] Check if dialog.NextClicked event is properly subscribed
- [ ] Verify the event handler is not being unsubscribed
- [ ] Check if multiple event handlers are conflicting
- [ ] Verify dialog.PrimaryButtonClick is bound to NextClicked

### 2. Current Step Tracking
- [ ] Verify currentStep value when ReviewConfigurationPage is displayed
- [ ] Check if currentStep matches expected value (4 for ImportResults)
- [ ] Trace currentStep updates throughout navigation
- [ ] Check if wizardState.CurrentStep is synchronized

### 3. NextClicked Handler Logic
- [ ] Add debug log at very start of NextClicked handler
- [ ] Check if handler is even being called
- [ ] Verify the condition for ImportResults is correct
- [ ] Check if any earlier conditions are catching the event

### 4. Dialog State
- [ ] Verify dialog.IsPrimaryButtonEnabled remains true
- [ ] Check if dialog is in correct state (not closing/closed)
- [ ] Verify Frame.Content is ReviewConfigurationPage
- [ ] Check if dialog.Hide() is being called prematurely

### 5. ReviewConfigurationPage State
- [ ] Verify BuildFinalConfiguration() can be called
- [ ] Check if all required data is present
- [ ] Verify IsReadyToExecute stays true
- [ ] Check if page is properly initialized

### 6. Potential Race Conditions
- [ ] Navigation timing issues
- [ ] State updates happening after button click
- [ ] Async operations interfering
- [ ] Event handler execution order

### 7. WizardDialog Implementation
- [ ] Check how NextClicked is raised in WizardDialog
- [ ] Verify PrimaryButtonClick handler in dialog
- [ ] Check if dialog has custom button handling
- [ ] Look for event suppression or cancellation

## Debug Strategy

1. **Add comprehensive logging**:
   - Log entry to NextClicked handler
   - Log all condition checks
   - Log currentStep value at each navigation
   - Log dialog state changes

2. **Trace execution flow**:
   - From button click to handler
   - Through all conditions
   - To final action

3. **Check dialog implementation**:
   - How WizardDialog raises NextClicked
   - Any special handling for final step

4. **Test with minimal case**:
   - Hardcode currentStep = 4
   - Remove condition checks temporarily
   - Verify basic handler execution

## Potential Issues to Check

1. **Event not firing**: Handler never called
2. **Wrong condition**: currentStep != 4 when expected
3. **Early return**: Some code exits before reaching our condition
4. **Dialog state**: Dialog preventing button action
5. **Exception swallowed**: Error happening but not visible
6. **Frame navigation**: Content not what we expect
7. **Timing issue**: State changes after click
