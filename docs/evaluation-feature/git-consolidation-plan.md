# Git Branch Consolidation Plan for Evaluation Feature

*Last Updated: June 20, 2025*
*Author: Senior Engineering Perspective*

## Executive Summary

We have 14+ branches spanning multiple development phases. For a clean PR to staging, we need to consolidate into a single, well-organized branch that tells a coherent story.

## Current State Analysis

### Branch Categories

1. **Phase 1 - Core Wizard** (6 branches) - All merged to main
2. **Phase 2 - UI Enhancements** (3 branches) - Mixed states
3. **Phase 3 - Bug Fixes** (4 branches) - All merged together
4. **Phase 4 - Insights Feature** (1 branch) - Current work

### Key Issues
- Multiple overlapping feature branches
- Some branches have build errors (e.g., `feature/eval-list-compact`)
- Unclear which branches were actually merged to main
- Mix of completed and abandoned work

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Single Feature Branch (RECOMMENDED)

Create one comprehensive branch from main with all changes:

```bash
# 1. Create fresh branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/evaluation-complete

# 2. Cherry-pick or merge only the essential commits
# Start with core features that are definitely working
git cherry-pick <commits from feature/evaluate-page-entry>
git cherry-pick <commits from wizard branches>
git cherry-pick <commits from feature/evaluation-wizard-fixes>
git cherry-pick <commits from feat/evaluation-insights-mvp>

# 3. Resolve conflicts and ensure build passes
# 4. Clean up commit history with interactive rebase
git rebase -i main
```

### Option 2: Staged Integration

If Option 1 is too complex, use staged merges:

```bash
# 1. Create integration branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/evaluation-staged-integration

# 2. Merge in phases
git merge feature/evaluation-wizard-fixes  # All bug fixes
git merge feat/evaluation-insights-mvp     # Insights feature

# 3. Test thoroughly between each merge
```

## Cleanup Steps

### 1. Identify What's Actually Needed

```bash
# List all evaluation-related branches
git branch -a | grep -E "(eval|evaluation)"

# Check what's already in main
git log main --grep="eval" --oneline

# Identify unique commits not in main
git log main..feature/evaluation-wizard-fixes --oneline
git log main..feat/evaluation-insights-mvp --oneline
```

### 2. Document Branch Status

| Branch | Keep | Action | Reason |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| `feature/evaluate-page-entry` | ❌ | Archive | Already in main |
| `feature/wizard-type-and-setup` | ❌ | Archive | Already in main |
| `feature/dataset-upload` | ❌ | Archive | Already in main |
| `feature/metrics-selection` | ❌ | Archive | Already in main |
| `feature/review-configuration` | ❌ | Archive | Already in main |
| `feature/complete-core-wizard` | ❌ | Archive | Already in main |
| `feature/eval-wizard-two-part-upload` | ❓ | Review | Check if merged |
| `feature/eval-list-cards-v2` | ❌ | Archive | Superseded by compact |
| `feature/eval-list-compact` | ❓ | Fix or abandon | Has build errors |
| `feature/evaluation-wizard-fixes` | ✅ | Include | Recent bug fixes |
| `feat/evaluation-insights-mvp` | ✅ | Include | Current feature |

### 3. Create Clean History

The final branch should have logical commits:

```
feature/evaluation-complete
├── feat: Add evaluation page and navigation
├── feat: Implement evaluation wizard workflow
│   ├── Add evaluation type selection
│   ├── Add dataset upload with validation
│   ├── Add metrics selection
│   └── Add review and confirmation
├── feat: Add evaluation list with multi-select
├── fix: Resolve wizard navigation issues
├── fix: Fix dataset UI refresh
├── feat: Add evaluation insights page
│   ├── Add data visualizations
│   ├── Add individual results browser
│   └── Add export functionality
└── feat: Add multi-evaluation comparison
```

## PR Preparation

### 1. Commit Organization

Group related changes into logical commits:

```bash
# Example of squashing related commits
git rebase -i main
# Mark commits as 'squash' to combine them
```

### 2. PR Description Template

```markdown
# Evaluation Feature Complete Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of the evaluation feature for AI Dev Gallery, including:
- Evaluation wizard with three workflows
- Results visualization and insights
- Multi-evaluation comparison
- Import/export capabilities

## Major Components

### 1. Evaluation Wizard
- Three workflows: Test Model, Evaluate Responses, Import Results
- Multi-step wizard with validation
- Support for JSONL and image folder inputs

### 2. Evaluation Management
- List view with multi-selection
- Status tracking and progress indicators
- Bulk operations support

### 3. Insights & Visualization
- Detailed results page with charts
- Individual result browser
- Statistical analysis
- Export to CSV/JSON/HTML

### 4. Comparison View
- Compare 2-5 evaluations side-by-side
- Model performance rankings
- Key statistics and insights

## Technical Details
- MVVM architecture with ViewModels
- Local storage with JSON persistence
- Lazy loading for performance
- Full accessibility support

## Testing
- [x] All wizard flows tested
- [x] Import/export functionality verified
- [x] UI responsive on different screen sizes
- [x] Accessibility features validated

## Known Limitations
- Backend execution not implemented (mock data only)
- Real-time progress updates pending
- Max 1000 images per evaluation (UI limit)

## Screenshots
[Include key screenshots]

## Related Documentation
- See `/docs/evaluation-feature/` for complete documentation
- Architecture decisions in `/docs/evaluation-feature/architecture/`
```

### 3. Pre-PR Checklist

- [ ] All code builds without warnings
- [ ] No merge conflicts with main
- [ ] All UI follows design system
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No hardcoded values or debug code
- [ ] Accessibility properties set
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 2s load times)
- [ ] Sample data reasonable and diverse

## Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Consolidation
1. Create `feature/evaluation-complete` branch
2. Integrate all working code
3. Fix any build issues
4. Clean up commit history

### Week 2: Polish
1. Update all documentation
2. Add missing comments
3. Remove debug code
4. Final testing pass

### Week 3: PR Submission
1. Create comprehensive PR description
2. Include screenshots and videos
3. Tag appropriate reviewers
4. Be ready for feedback

## Post-Merge Cleanup

After successful merge:

```bash
# Delete old feature branches
git branch -d feature/evaluation-wizard-fixes
git branch -d feat/evaluation-insights-mvp
# ... etc

# Tag the release
git tag -a "evaluation-feature-v1.0" -m "Complete evaluation feature"
```

## Summary

The cleanest approach is to create a single, well-organized feature branch that includes all the evaluation work. This makes the PR review much easier and provides a clear history of the feature development.

Key principles:
1. **One branch to rule them all** - Consolidate everything
2. **Clean history** - Logical, squashed commits
3. **Complete documentation** - Everything reviewers need
4. **No surprises** - Document all limitations
5. **Ready for production** - Even if it's going to staging first
