- ‚úÖ Fixed date issues (now using correct June 2025)
- ‚úÖ Removed references to non-existent files
- ‚úÖ Deleted empty work-docs folder

### Redundancy Removed

- Overlapping design documents archived by phase
- Conflicting status information resolved
- Old TODO items properly categorized

### Structure Improvements
- Clear separation between current and archive
- Logical organization by development phase
- Easy navigation with README files
- Consistent date formatting

## üìã Documentation Guidelines

### When to Create New Docs
1. **Don't create stub files** - Wait until feature is implemented
2. **Document what exists** - Not what's planned
3. **Keep archives unchanged** - They're historical records

### How to Maintain
1. Update TODO.md as tasks complete
2. Update current-state.md after major changes
3. Create new guides only when features ship
4. Archive old designs when making major pivots

## Notes

The documentation is now clean and accurately reflects the current state:
- UI/UX is complete with V3 compact list design
- **Evaluation Insights feature is fully implemented** ‚ú®
- **Comparison view is complete and functional** ‚ú®
- Backend execution is not implemented
- Import Results workflow is the only one that produces real data
- All other workflows create mock evaluation records

This structure will grow organically as features are implemented.
