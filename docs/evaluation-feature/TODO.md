- ‚è≥ Custom criteria scoring
- ‚è≥ Score aggregation and normalization

### Results Storage
- ‚è≥ Extend EvaluationResultsStore for in-progress updates
- ‚è≥ Stream results to disk during execution
- ‚è≥ Handle partial results on failure
- ‚è≥ Implement resume capability

## Phase 4: Import/Export Enhancement ‚è≥ PLANNED

- ‚è≥ Export to Excel
- ‚è≥ Export to PDF report
- ‚è≥ Customizable export templates
- ‚è≥ Bulk export operations

## Phase 5: Advanced Features ‚è≥ FUTURE

### Comparison View
- ‚è≥ Multi-evaluation selection
- ‚è≥ Side-by-side comparison
- ‚è≥ Diff visualization
- ‚è≥ Comparison reports

### Enterprise Features
- ‚è≥ Evaluation templates
- ‚è≥ Scheduled evaluations
- ‚è≥ Cost estimation/tracking
- ‚è≥ Team collaboration
- ‚è≥ Audit logging
- ‚è≥ API for external tools

### Performance & Scale
- ‚è≥ Support for >1000 items
- ‚è≥ Streaming for large datasets
- ‚è≥ Parallel execution
- ‚è≥ Cloud storage integration
- ‚è≥ Distributed processing

## Known Issues & Bugs

### High Priority
- üîÑ Running evaluations show progress but never complete (no backend)
- üîÑ Compare button shows "Coming Soon" (needs implementation)
- üîÑ No actual model execution happens

### Medium Priority
- ‚è≥ Search/filter UI exists but not functional
- ‚è≥ Progress bars are static mockups
- ‚è≥ Scores show 0.0 for new evaluations

### Low Priority
- ‚è≥ Timezone handling for timestamps
- ‚è≥ Accessibility improvements needed
- ‚è≥ Print styling not implemented

## Technical Debt

### Code Organization
- ‚è≥ Extract common UI patterns to shared controls
- ‚è≥ Consolidate validation logic

- ‚è≥ Deployment guide
- ‚è≥ Performance benchmarks

## Notes

### Design Decisions
- Moved from card-based to row-based design for efficiency
- Chose 1-5 star rating over 0-1 scores for clarity
- Implemented local-first storage before cloud sync
- Prioritized import workflow for immediate value

### Dependencies
- Waiting on AI Toolkit team for model execution APIs
- Credential Manager integration pending security review
- Chart library selection pending performance testing

### Resources
