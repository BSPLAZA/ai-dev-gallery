# Current State of Evaluation Feature

*Last Updated: June 20, 2025*

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### Core UI/UX (100% Complete)
- **Three evaluation workflows**:
  - **Test Model**: Configure model and dataset for evaluation
  - **Evaluate Responses**: Score existing model outputs  
  - **Import Results**: Bring in external evaluation data
- **Multi-model configuration** (UI only, no execution):
  - GPT-4o
  - Phi-4 Multimodal
  - Azure AI Vision (Image Analysis 4.0)
  - Image Description API (local AI) with teaching UI
- **Evaluation metrics** (UI selection only):
  - SPICE Score (default)
  - CLIP Score (default)
  - METEOR Score
  - Length Statistics
  - AI Judge with custom criteria
- **Dataset support**:
  - JSONL format parsing and validation
  - Image folder import (up to 1,000 items)
  - Two-part upload for workflows 2 & 3

### User Interface Implementation
- **V3 Compact List Design** (using EvaluationListRow):
  - 72px efficient row height
  - Checkbox multi-selection
  - Floating action bar for bulk operations
  - Empty state with actionable guidance
  - Search and filtering (UI present, not functional)
  - Workflow type indicators (üì• for imports, üß™ for tests)
- **Complete Wizard Implementation**:
  - 6-step configuration flow
  - Progress indicator with step tracking
  - State preservation across navigation
  - Real-time validation at each step
  - Back/Next navigation with proper state handling
- **Consistent Design System**:
  - Blue accent colors (SystemFillColorAttentionBrush)
  - Theme-aware controls throughout
  - FontIcon usage instead of emojis for consistency
  - Accessibility properties on interactive elements

### Data Persistence
- **EvaluationResultsStore Implementation**:
  - Saves evaluations as JSON files in ApplicationData.LocalFolder
  - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Import Results workflow creates completed evaluations
  - Sample data generation on first run
  - Proper score normalization (0-1 to 1-5 scale conversion)

## ‚ùå NOT Implemented (Backend)

### Execution Infrastructure
- **No EvaluationExecutor service** - cannot run actual evaluations
- **No API integration** - models are not called
- **No metrics calculation** - scores are either imported or 0.0
- **No progress tracking** - progress bars are static mockups
- **No background processing** - evaluations show "Running" but don't execute
- **No cancellation support** - no way to stop a "running" evaluation

### Recently Completed Features ‚úÖ
- **Evaluation Insights Page** - Fully implemented with:
  - Data visualizations (bar charts, table view)
  - Individual results browser with file tree
  - Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, HTML report)
  - Statistical summaries and folder analysis
  - Custom metadata support
- **Comparison functionality** - Complete implementation:
  - Side-by-side comparison of 2-5 evaluations
  - Interactive grouped bar charts
  - Model rankings with medal emojis
  - Key statistics and detailed scores table
  - Full export support

### Still Missing Features
- **Search/Filter** - UI exists but not functional
- **Real-time updates** - no progress updates during execution

## üöß Current Limitations

- Maximum dataset: 1,000 images (UI validation only)
- JSONL file size: 100MB limit (UI validation only)
- All evaluations are essentially mock data
- "Running" status is cosmetic only
- Scores only populate from imported data

## üéØ Next Development Phases

### Phase 2: Visualization ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Evaluation Insights Page with charts
- [x] Individual image results viewer
- [x] Score distribution visualizations
- [x] Criteria breakdown displays
- [x] Comparison view for multiple evaluations
- [x] Export functionality (CSV, JSON, HTML)

### Phase 3: Backend Implementation
- [ ] EvaluationExecutor service
- [ ] API client implementations
- [ ] Real metrics calculation
- [ ] Progress tracking system
- [ ] Background job queue

### Phase 4: Import/Export Enhancement
- [ ] Export to CSV/Excel/JSON
- [ ] Import preview dialog
- [ ] Multiple format support
- [ ] Batch operations

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for detailed task breakdown.

## Documentation Guidelines

### When to Create New Docs
1. **Don't create stub files** - Wait until feature is implemented
2. **Document what exists** - Not what's planned
3. **Keep archives unchanged** - They're historical records

### How to Maintain
1. Update TODO.md as tasks complete
2. Update current-state.md after major changes
3. Create new guides only when features ship
4. Archive old designs when making major pivots
