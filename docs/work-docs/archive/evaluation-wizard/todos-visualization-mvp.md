# Visualization MVP - Granular Task List

## üéØ Goal
Transform the evaluation experience by creating rich visualizations for imported evaluation data (JSONL files with scores). We're focusing on the Import Results workflow because it's the easiest to implement - users already have evaluation data with scores, so we can provide immediate value through visualization without building backend execution infrastructure.

## üìå Why Import Results First?
- **Immediate Value**: Users can visualize their existing evaluation data today
- **No Backend Required**: Skip complex API integrations and model execution
- **Simpler Implementation**: Just parse JSONL and display beautiful charts
- **Proof of Concept**: Validate the UI/UX before investing in execution infrastructure
- **Real Data**: Users already have evaluation results from other tools

Focus on three main deliverables:
1. Rich evaluation list with card-based UI
2. Comprehensive insights page with multiple views  
3. Multi-evaluation comparison capability
