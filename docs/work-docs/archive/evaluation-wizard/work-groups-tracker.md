## 🚦 Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Chart Library Performance** - May need custom implementation
2. **Image Loading at Scale** - Need robust virtualization
3. **User Adoption** - Need clear value proposition

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Early prototype of charts with real data
2. Test with 1000+ images early
3. Regular user feedback sessions
