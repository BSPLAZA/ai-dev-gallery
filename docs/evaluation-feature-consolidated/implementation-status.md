## Known Limitations

### Build Issues
Both PRs have minor build failures due to:
- XML spacing violations
- Code formatting issues
- StyleCop warnings
- No functional impact

### Technical Limitations

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Currently uses mock data only
   - No real API calls implemented
   - Simulated evaluation processing

2. **Performance**
   - Limited to 1,000 items per evaluation
   - Basic chart implementations
   - No streaming for large datasets

3. **Export Options**
   - Limited to JSON and CSV
   - No Excel export yet
   - Basic formatting only

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Basic statistics only
   - No advanced ML metrics
   - Limited to predefined calculations

5. **Comparison**
   - Maximum 4 evaluations at once
   - No cross-dataset analysis
   - Basic trend detection only

## Accessibility Gaps

While basic accessibility is implemented, these areas need improvement:

- **Dynamic Announcements**: List updates aren't announced
- **Chart Descriptions**: Could be more detailed
- **Focus Return**: After operations, focus placement needs work
- **Live Regions**: Better management needed
- **Keyboard Support**: Some chart interactions missing

## Testing Status

### ✅ Tested and Working
- All three evaluation workflows
- Wizard navigation and validation
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Multi-selection and bulk operations
- Search and filtering
- View switching (card/list)
- Basic accessibility features
- Export functionality
- Statistical calculations
- Comparison features

### ⚠️ Not Tested
- Performance with 1000+ items
- Memory usage over extended periods
- Concurrent evaluation handling
- Network error scenarios (future)
- All accessibility scenarios

## Platform Support

- **Tested On**: Windows 11 x64
- **Framework**: WinUI 3
- **.NET Version**: 8.0
- **Minimum Windows**: Windows 10 1903+

## Future Work Required

### High Priority
1. Fix build issues (formatting, spacing)
2. Implement real backend integration
3. Improve accessibility gaps
4. Add comprehensive error handling

### Medium Priority
1. Advanced charting library
2. Excel export support
3. Performance optimizations
4. Additional statistical metrics

### Low Priority
1. Cross-platform considerations
2. Cloud storage integration
3. Collaborative features
4. Advanced ML metrics

## Code Quality

- Follows MVVM pattern consistently
- Proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive XML documentation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Minimal code duplication

## Dependencies

No new NuGet packages required - uses only:
- WinUI 3 built-in controls
- .NET 8.0 standard libraries
- Windows App SDK

## Deployment Notes

When these PRs are merged:
1. No database migrations needed
2. No configuration changes required
3. Sample data auto-generates on first run
4. Backward compatible with existing app
