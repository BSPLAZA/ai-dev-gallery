## 🎯 Summary

This PR introduces the foundational evaluation system for AI Dev Gallery, enabling users to systematically test, measure, and analyze AI model performance across various datasets and metrics. Includes accessibility improvements merged from the technical improvements branch.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Complete Evaluation Wizard** (6-step workflow)
- **Step 1: Workflow Selection** - Choose evaluation type
- **Step 2: Evaluation Type** - Configure evaluation approach
- **Step 3: Model Configuration** - Set up model parameters
- **Step 4: Dataset Upload** - Import test data (JSONL/images)
- **Step 5: Metrics Selection** - Choose evaluation criteria
- **Step 6: Review & Launch** - Confirm settings and start

### 2. **Three Evaluation Workflows**
- **Test Model**: Real-time model evaluation with direct API calls
- **Evaluate Responses**: Score pre-generated model outputs
- **Import Results**: Bring in external evaluation data for analysis

### 3. **Evaluation Management**
- **List View**: Modern card-based and compact list layouts
- **Multi-Selection**: Bulk operations with checkbox selection
- **Search & Filter**: Find evaluations by name, model, or dataset
- **Status Tracking**: Running, Completed, Failed, Imported states

### 4. **Data Persistence**
- Local storage using ApplicationData
- Automatic sample data generation
- Support for large datasets (up to 1,000 items)
- JSONL import/export capabilities

## 📝 Technical Details

### Files Changed
- **Total**: 34 files, 9,649+ lines added
- **New Components**:
  - `WizardDialog.xaml/cs` - Reusable wizard framework with validation UI
  - `EvaluatePage.xaml/cs` - Main evaluation list with accessibility
  - `EvaluationCard.xaml/cs` - Card view component
  - `EvaluationListRow.xaml/cs` - List row with keyboard navigation
  - `SelectionActionBar.xaml/cs` - Bulk action controls
  - 6 wizard step pages (Workflow, Type, Model, Dataset, Metrics, Review)

### Models & Data Structures
```csharp
- EvaluationResult - Core evaluation data model
- EvaluationWizardState - Wizard state management
- EvaluationWorkflow - Enum for workflow types
- EvaluationStatus - Enum for evaluation states
- DatasetConfiguration - Dataset settings
- FolderStats - Folder-based statistics
```

### ViewModels
- `EvaluationListItemViewModel` - List item presentation
- `EvaluationCardViewModel` - Card view presentation

### Services
- `EvaluationResultsStore` - Data persistence and retrieval
- Sample data generation for first-time users

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ All three workflows tested end-to-end
- ✅ Dataset upload validation (JSONL and image folders)
- ✅ Multi-selection and bulk operations
- ✅ Search and filtering functionality
- ✅ Navigation between pages
- ✅ Data persistence across app sessions
- ✅ Error handling and validation messages
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Space, Enter)
- ✅ Screen reader announcements

### Test Environment
- **Platform**: Windows 11
- **Architecture**: x64
- **Framework**: WinUI 3
- **.NET Version**: 8.0

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Modern Design**: Follows Windows 11 design language
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to window sizes
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators during operations
- **Empty States**: Helpful guidance for new users
- **Validation**: Real-time input validation with clear messages
- **Tooltips**: Context-sensitive help throughout
- **Validation Error Bar**: InfoBar for wizard validation errors

## ♿ Accessibility (Enhanced)

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full support with Tab, Space to select, Enter to open
- **Screen Reader Support**: AutomationProperties with names and descriptions
- **Live Regions**: Dynamic content announcements
- **Heading Levels**: Proper document structure
- **High Contrast**: Tested with Windows high contrast themes
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+N for new evaluation, Ctrl+F for search
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus states
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Compliance improvements

## 🔄 State Management

- Wizard state preserved during navigation
- Evaluation list updates automatically
- Selection state maintained during operations
- Search/filter state persisted

## 📦 Dependencies

- No new NuGet packages required
- Uses existing WinUI 3 controls
- Compatible with existing app architecture

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **Placeholder Dialogs**: Insights and comparison features show "coming soon" dialogs (implemented in next PR)
2. **Backend Integration**: Currently uses local storage only (backend API integration planned)
3. **Dataset Size**: Limited to 1,000 items for performance

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for large evaluation lists
- Virtualized list views for smooth scrolling
- Efficient search implementation
- Minimal memory footprint

## 🔒 Security

- No sensitive data exposed in UI
- Local storage only (no network calls yet)
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Safe file path handling

## 📋 Checklist

- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Comments added for complex logic
- [x] No console warnings or errors
- [x] Tested on Windows 11
- [x] Accessibility tested with keyboard and Narrator
