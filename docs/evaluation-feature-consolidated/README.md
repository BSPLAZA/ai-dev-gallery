### Insights & Analytics (PR #6 / #25)
- **Individual Evaluation Analysis** with score distributions and metrics
- **Multi-Evaluation Comparison** supporting up to 4 evaluations
- **Statistical Analysis** - Mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Charts, radar plots, trend analysis
- **Export Capabilities** - JSON and CSV formats
- **Print-Friendly Reports** with key insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Framework**: WinUI 3 with Windows App SDK
- **Language**: C# (.NET 8.0)
- **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with service layer
- **Data Storage**: Local ApplicationData (future: API integration)
- **UI Components**: Native WinUI controls
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (with minor gaps)

## ‚úÖ What's Working

- All three evaluation workflows functional
- Complete wizard flow with validation
- Data persistence and sample generation
- Search, filter, and multi-selection
- Individual evaluation insights
- Multi-evaluation comparison
- Statistical calculations
- Export functionality (JSON/CSV)
- Keyboard navigation and basic screen reader support

## üöß Known Limitations

1. **Backend**: Currently uses mock data (no real API calls)
2. **Performance**: Limited to 1,000 items per evaluation
3. **Charts**: Basic WinUI controls (advanced charting planned)
4. **Export**: Limited to JSON/CSV (Excel planned)
5. **Accessibility**: Some gaps in dynamic content announcements

See [Known Issues](./known-issues.md) for complete details.
