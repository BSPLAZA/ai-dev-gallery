# AI Dev Gallery ‚Äî Personal Fork (Proof of Concept)

> **TL;DR**: This repository is **not** the official Microsoft project. It‚Äôs my personal fork used to showcase a **new Evaluation tab** concept I built as a proof-of-concept (POC).  
> If you‚Äôre looking for the real project, go here ‚Üí **[microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery)**.

## Why this repo exists
I cloned the upstream repo and opened a couple of symbolic PRs in **this** fork to document and demonstrate the work I did (mostly front-end). Those PRs capture the design, UX, and implementation approach for an **Evaluation** experience inside AI Dev Gallery.

- ü§ñ **Built with AI coding agents:** I used **Claude Code** and **GitHub Copilot** to accelerate scaffolding, refactors, and test stubs during this POC.
- üì¶ This fork is for **show & tell** only (a POC / ‚Äúvibe-coded‚Äù exploration).
- üß≠ For source of truth, docs, issues, and downloads, use the **official** repo linked above.

## What to look at (my work)
The two PRs below summarize the core of this POC and include descriptions/screenshots of the feature set.

1) **PR #5 ‚Äì Evaluation Core Feature with Evaluation Wizard Dialog**  
   **Link:** https://github.com/BSPLAZA/ai-dev-gallery/pull/5  
   *Adds a complete Evaluation workflow and the new Evaluation tab foundation.*
   - 6-step **Evaluation Wizard** (workflow ‚Üí type ‚Üí model ‚Üí dataset ‚Üí metrics ‚Üí review)
   - Three evaluation modes: **Test Model**, **Evaluate Responses**, **Import Results**
   - Evaluation management views (card + list), **search/filter**, bulk selection, and status tracking
   - Local data persistence and sample data generation
   - Keyboard navigation & screen-reader support (accessibility improvements)

   **Link:** https://github.com/BSPLAZA/ai-dev-gallery/pull/6  
   *Builds on the core to add analytics and comparison.*
   - **Insights view** with score distributions and criteria breakdowns
   - **Compare** up to 4 evaluations side-by-side
   - Basic statistics (mean/median/std dev), trends, and item-level analysis
   - **Export** evaluation results (JSON/CSV)
   - Continued focus on performance and accessibility
