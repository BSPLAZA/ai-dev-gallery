# AI Dev Gallery ‚Äî Personal Fork (Proof of Concept)

> **TL;DR**: This repository is **not** the official Microsoft project. It‚Äôs my personal fork used to showcase a **new Evaluation tab** concept I built as a proof-of-concept (POC).  
> If you‚Äôre looking for the real project, go here ‚Üí **[microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-Dev-Gallery)**.

## Why this repo exists
I cloned the upstream repo and opened a couple of symbolic PRs in **this** fork to document and demonstrate the work I did (mostly front-end). Those PRs capture the design, UX, and implementation approach for an **Evaluation** experience inside AI Dev Gallery.

- ü§ñ **Built with AI coding agents:** I used **Claude Code** and **GitHub Copilot** to accelerate scaffolding, refactors, and test stubs during this POC.
- üì¶ This fork is for **show & tell** only (a POC / ‚Äúvibe-coded‚Äù exploration).
- üß≠ For source of truth, docs, issues, and downloads, use the **official** repo linked above.
